## Notes - Frontend

- Delete everything.
- index.js handles Redux
- App.js handles routing
- Action Creators in Redux are somewhere we create change in the Redux side of our application. They are used to modify the state that is contained inside our Redux store.
- To hook up a component to Redux Store
  - import connect helper from react-redux
  - Define map state to props function
  - Pull out pieces of state to use in the particular component
